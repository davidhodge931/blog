      <description>One-way ANOVA is a test used to assess whether there is a statistically significant difference between the mean of groups.
There is 1 response numeric variable and 1 explanatory categorical variable with more than 1 level.
ANOVA assesses the ratio of explained variance to unexplained variance in the complete model, if the null hypothesis is true that all population means are equal.
There is a distribution of sample F statistics with different probabilities, if the null hypothesis was true of no difference between means.</description>
