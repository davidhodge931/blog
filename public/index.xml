      <description>One-way ANOVA is a test used to assess whether there is a statistically significant difference between the mean of different levels of a factor.
So in this case, there is a response numeric variable and an explanatory categorical variable with more than 1 level.
ANOVA considers the probability of observing the sample ratio of explained variance to unexplained variance (i.e. the F statistic), if the null hypothesis is true that all population means are equal.</description>
