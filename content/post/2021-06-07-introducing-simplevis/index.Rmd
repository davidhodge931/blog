### Introduction

`simplevis` is a package of `ggplot2` wrapper functions that aims to make beautiful `ggplot2` visualisation with less brainpower and typing!

This blog will provide an overview of: 

* the visualisation family types that `simplevis` currently supports
* how visualisation families support combinations of colouring (by a variable), facetting. both or neither.

```{r}
library(simplevis)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### Visualisation family types

bar

```{r}
plot_data <- storms %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(wind = mean(wind))

gg_bar(plot_data, year, wind)
```

point

```{r}
gg_point(iris, Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length)
```

line

```{r}
plot_data <- storms %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(wind = mean(wind))

gg_line(plot_data, year, wind)
```

boxplot

```{r}
gg_boxplot(penguins, species, body_mass_g)
```

hbar (i.e horizontal bar)

```{r, fig.height = 3}
plot_data <- ggplot2::diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarise(price = mean(price))

gg_hbar(plot_data, price, cut)
```

sf (short for simple features map)

```{r}
gg_sf(example_point, borders = example_borders)
```

### Colouring, facetting, neither or both

Each visualisation family generally has 4 functions.

The function name specifies whether or not a visualisation is to be coloured by a variable `*_col()`, facetted by a variable `*_facet()`, neither `*()` or both of these `*_col_facet()`. 

Colouring by a variable means that different values of a selected variable are to have different colours. Facetting means that different values of a selected variable are to have their facet.

A `*()` function such `gg_point()` requires only a dataset, an x variable and a y variable. 

```{r}
gg_point(penguins, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g)
```

A `*_col()` function such `gg_point_col()` requires only a dataset, an x variable, a y variable, and a colour variable. 
```{r}
gg_point_col(penguins, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex)
```

A `*_facet()` function such `gg_point_facet()` requires only a dataset, an x variable, a y variable, and a facet variable. 

```{r}
gg_point_facet(penguins, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g, species)
```

A `*_col_facet()` function such `gg_point_col_facet()` requires only a dataset, an x variable, a y variable, a colour variable, and a facet variable. 

```{r}
gg_point_col_facet(penguins, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, species)
```

Data is generally plotted with a stat of `identity`, which means data is plotted as is. Only for boxplot, there is a different default stat of boxplot, which means data will be transformed to boxplot statistics.
