### Introduction

`simplevis` provides `gglot2` (and `leaflet`) wrapper functions with an objective to help users make beautiful visualisation with less brainpower.

This post will discuss the leaflet wrappers that have been provided to make leaflet easier to work with.
The way these functions have been designed is to follow the logic of the `ggplot2` wrapper functions. 

### sf objects

The `sf` package makes it easy to work with vector data (e.g. points, lines or polygons).

sf objects have a list column called `geometry` on the end of the dataset, as well as some meta data describing the coordinate reference system etc. 

```{r}
example_point
```
### simplevis ggplot wrappers

Note that to create `sf` `ggplot2` maps with `simplevis`:

* Data must be an `sf` object 
* Data must be of `POINT`/`MULTIPOINT`, `LINESTRING`/`MULTILINESTRING`, or `POLYGON`/`MULTIPOLYGON` geometry type
* Data must have a coordinate reference system (CRS) defined
* No `x_var` and `y_var` variables are required

```{r, fig.height = 4}
gg_sf_col(example_point,  
          col_var = trend_category, 
          borders = example_borders)
```

These maps can be facetted or made interactive in the same way as other `ggplot2` objects  with `plotly::ggplotly`.

The borders argument is any sf object of any sort of administrative or natural contextial borders and boundaries that you would like for your map. In the example above, a New Zealand coastline sf object has been provided to the `borders` argument.

### simplevis leaflet wrappers

The `simplevis` leaflet wrappers largely work in exactly the same way.

```{r}
leaf_sf_col(example_point, 
            col_var = median, 
            col_method = "quantile",
            col_cuts = seq(0, 1, 0.25),
            col_title = "Monitored medians, 2008-17")
```


```{r}
leaf_sf_col(example_polygon, density, 
            col_method = "bin", 
            col_cuts = c(0, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, Inf), 
            col_title = "Modelled density, 2017")
```

The clickable popup will default to a `leafpop::popupTable` of all variables, but popups can be adjusted to a subset of column using the `popup_vars_vctr` argument.

```{r}
leaf_sf_col(example_point, 
               col_var = trend_category, 
               popup_vars_vctr = c("site_id", "median"))
```

The hover label will default to the colour variable, but can be adjusted using the `label_var` variable. 

```{r}
leaf_sf_col(example_point, 
               col_var = trend_category, 
               label_var = site_id)
```

Users have a `basemap` argument that defaults to "light", but there are other options.

```{r}
leaf_sf(example_point, 
           basemap = "dark")
```

### Adding additional layers

As a leaflet object is produced, you can add additional layers with leaflet - although this may effect popups and labels.

```{r}
leaf_sf_col(example_point, 
               col_var = trend_category) %>% 
  leaflet::addPolygons(data = sf::st_transform(example_borders, 4326), 
                       color = "#35B779", 
                       weight = 3, 
                       fillOpacity = 0, 
                       opacity = 1)
```

### leaflet basemap stack for shiny

A leaflet basemap stack is available for use in shiny apps. It defaults to the top layer being "light". You can set the bounds by adding a vector or bbox of bounds.

```{r}
leaf_basemap(bounds = c(166.70047,-34.45676, 178.52966,-47.06345))
```

You can also specify the top layer.

```{r}
library(sf)
leaf_basemap(bounds = c(166.70047,-34.45676, 178.52966,-47.06345), 
             basemap = "satellite") 
```
