### Introduction

In addition to `gglot2` wrapper functions, `simplevis` also provides `leaflet` wrapper functions as a bonus.

The way these functions have been designed is to follow the logic of the `ggplot2` wrapper functions. 

```{r}
library(simplevis)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### sf objects

The `sf` package makes it easy to work with vector data (e.g. points, lines or polygons).

sf objects have a list column called `geometry` on the end of the dataset, as well as some meta data describing the coordinate reference system etc. 

```{r}
example_sf_point
```
### simplevis ggplot wrappers

Note that to create `sf` `ggplot2` maps with `simplevis`:

* Data must be an `sf` object 
* Data must be of `POINT`/`MULTIPOINT`, `LINESTRING`/`MULTILINESTRING`, or `POLYGON`/`MULTIPOLYGON` geometry type
* Data must have a coordinate reference system (CRS) defined
* No `x_var` and `y_var` variables are required

```{r, fig.height = 4}
gg_sf_col(example_sf_point,  
          col_var = trend_category, 
          borders = nz)
```

These maps can be facetted or made interactive in the same way as other `ggplot2` objects  with `plotly::ggplotly`.

The borders argument is any sf object of any sort of administrative or natural contextial borders and boundaries that you would like for your map. In the example above, a New Zealand coastline sf object has been provided to the `borders` argument.

### simplevis leaflet wrappers

The `simplevis` leaflet wrappers largely work in exactly the same way.

```{r}
leaflet_sf_col(example_sf_point, 
               col_var = median, 
               col_method = "quantile",
               col_cuts = seq(0, 1, 0.25),
               title = "Monitored medians, 2008-17")
```


```{r}
leaflet_sf_col(example_sf_polygon, density,
     col_method = "bin", 
     col_cuts = c(0, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, Inf),
     title = "Modelled density, 2017")
```

The clickable popup will default to a `leafpop::popupTable` of all variables, but popups can be adjusted to a subset of column using the `popup_vars_vctr` argument.

```{r}
leaflet_sf_col(example_sf_point, 
               col_var = trend_category, 
               popup_vars_vctr = c("site_id", "median"))
```

The hover label will default to the colour variable, but can be adjusted using the `label_var` variable. 

```{r}
leaflet_sf_col(example_sf_point, 
               col_var = trend_category, 
               label_var = site_id)
```

Users have a `basemap` argument that defaults to "light", but there are other options.

```{r}
leaflet_sf(example_sf_point, 
           basemap = "dark")
```

### Adding additional layers

As a leaflet object is produced, you can add additional layers with leaflet - although this may effect popups and labels.

```{r}
leaflet_sf_col(example_sf_point, 
               col_var = trend_category) %>% 
  leaflet::addPolygons(data = nz, 
                       color = "#35B779", 
                       weight = 3, 
                       fillOpacity = 0, 
                       opacity = 1)
```

### leaflet basemap stack for shiny

A leaflet basemap stack is available for use in shiny apps. It defaults to the top layer being "light". You can set the bounds by adding a vector or bbox of bounds.

```{r}
leaflet_basemap(bounds = c(166.70047,-34.45676, 178.52966,-47.06345))
```

You can also specify the top layer.

```{r}
library(sf)
leaflet_basemap(bounds = c(166.70047,-34.45676, 178.52966,-47.06345), 
                top_layer = "satellite") 
```
