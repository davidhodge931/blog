### Introduction

`simplevis` provides `gglot2` (and `leaflet`) wrapper functions with an objective to help users make beautiful visualisation with less brainpower.

In the current post, we will discus the simplified and consistent method for colouring that simplevis has adopted.  

### Overview

In simplevis, users adhere to the following rules for adjusting colour:

1. Always define the colours to use via the `pal` argument (short for palette) 
2. If colouring by a variable, use a `*_col()` or `*_col_facet()` function, and define the `col_var`
3. For `gg_sf_col*()` and `gg_point_col*()` functions where the `col_var` is numeric, also define the `col_method` of `bin` or `quantile`, and the `col_cuts` to use.  

```{r}
library(simplevis)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### 1. Always define the colours to use via the `pal` argument 

The colour palette can be changed from the default viridis colours by providing a character vector of hex codes to the `pal` argument.

```{r}
gg_point(penguins, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g, pal = "#e7298a")

```

Users can get access to a large amount of colour palettes through the `pals` package.

### 2. If colouring by a variable, use a `*_col()` or `*_col_facet()` function, and define the `col_var`

To colour by a variable, use a `*_col()` function and then define that variable to be coloured using the `col_var` argument.

```{r}
gg_point_col(penguins, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g, species)
```

### 3. For `gg_sf_col*()` and `gg_point_col*()` functions where colouring by a numeric variable, also define the `col_method` and `col_cuts`

All `simplevis` `*_col()` and `*_col_facet()` functions support colouring by a categorical variable.

In addition, `sf` and `point` `*_col()` and `*_col_facet()` functions support colouring by a numeric variable.

You do this by specifying whether you want to do this by:

* defining whether the col_method is to be by `bin` or `quantile`
* defining a vector or col_cuts. These should be between 0 and infinity (`Inf`) for `bin` and between 0 and 1 for `quantile`

```{r}
plot_data <- ggplot2::diamonds %>% 
  slice_sample(prop = 0.01)

plot_data

gg_point_col(plot_data, 
                 x_var = carat, 
                 y_var = price, 
                 col_var = z,
                 col_method = "quantile",
                 col_cuts = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))
```


```{r}
gg_point_col(plot_data, 
                 x_var = carat, 
                 y_var = price, 
                 col_var = z,
                 col_method = "bin",
                 col_cuts = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Inf))
```
