### Introduction

`simplevis` provides `gglot2` (and `leaflet`) wrapper functions to make it easier to make beautiful visualisation with less brainpower required.

In the [first simplevis blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/06/simplevis-simple-ggplot2-visualisation-with-less-brainpower-and-typing/), we discussed how `simplevis` provides families of functions for when the user is colouring or facetting by a variable or both or neither. 

In the [2nd simplevis blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/06/simplevis-simple-methods-for-adding-colour-to-visualisations/), we discussed how colouring works with `simplevis`. 

In the [3rd simplevis blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/06/simplevis-simple-methods-to-adjust-titles-and-scales/), we discussed how titles and scales can be manipulated in `simplevis`. 

In the current post, we discus how to make your`simplevis` ggplot2 plots interactive html widgets using `plotly::ggplotly`, including how to fine-tune your tooltips. 

Make sure you have the latest version of `simplevis` from CRAN, so that everything runs smoothly (and also that you can access the `gg_density*` family, which has just been released).

### Turning a ggplot into an interactive html widget

The `plotly::ggplotly` function provides the ability to convert the ggplot object to an interactive `plotly` html object. 

Given that `simplevis` functions are generally `ggplot2` wrapper functions that output ggplot2 objects, we can use this `plotly::ggplotly` function on our output object to make it interactive.

This is pretty magical, as it is just so easy - thanks `plotly`!

```{r}
plot <- gg_point_col(penguins, 
                     x_var = bill_length_mm, 
                     y_var = body_mass_g, 
                     col_var = species, 
                     font_family = "Helvetica")

plotly::ggplotly(plot) 
```

### Turning off widgets other than the camera

The `plotly` widgets can sometimes look a bit cluttered, especially you are not using them.

Therefore, `simplevis` provides a `plotly_camera` function to turn off all widgets other than the camera.

```{r}
plot <- gg_point_col(penguins, 
                     x_var = bill_length_mm, 
                     y_var = body_mass_g, 
                     col_var = species, 
                     font_family = "Helvetica")

plotly::ggplotly(plot) %>% 
  plotly_camera()
  
```

### Controlling the tooltip

Some users may want to have _more_ or _different_ variables in the tooltip than `plotly::ggplotly` defaults provide.

`plotly::ggplotly` provides a method for this which `simplevis` uses.

In the `simplevis` `gg_*` function, users can add a variable can be added to the `text_var` that can be used as the tooltip (for functions other than `gg_density*()` and `gg_boxplot*()`). 

This variable is then used in the `ggplotly` tooltip when `tooltip = text` is added to the `ggplotly` function.

`simplevis` provides a `mutate_text` function which makes it easy to create a column that is a string of variable names and associated values separated by breaks for the tooltip.

This function creates a new column called `text` that can then be added to the `text_var` in the `gg*()` function. 

If no column names are provided in a vector to `mutate_text`, then it defaults to providing all variable names and associated values in the dataset.

```{r}
plot_data <- penguins %>% 
  mutate_text()

plot <- gg_point_col(plot_data, 
                     x_var = bill_length_mm, 
                     y_var = body_mass_g, 
                     col_var = species, 
                     text_var = text, 
                     font_family = "Helvetica")

plotly::ggplotly(plot, tooltip = "text") %>% 
  plotly_camera()
```

A vector of column names can be provided to `mutate_text` function to get the exact arguments that the user in looking for. Note mutate_text converts column names to sentence case using the `snakecase::to_sentence_case` function. 

```{r}
plot_data <- penguins %>% 
  mutate_text(c("species", "flipper_length_mm"))

plot <- gg_point_col(plot_data, 
                     x_var = bill_length_mm, 
                     y_var = body_mass_g, 
                     col_var = species, 
                     text_var = text, 
                     font_family = "Helvetica")

plotly::ggplotly(plot, tooltip = "text") %>% 
  plotly_camera()
```

You can also use this method if you were using `ggplot2`.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

plot_data <- penguins %>% 
  mutate_text()

plot <- ggplot(plot_data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                 y = body_mass_g, 
                 col = species, 
                 text = text))

plotly::ggplotly(plot, tooltip = "text") %>% 
  plotly_camera()
```
