One-way ANOVA is a test used to assess whether there is a statistically significant difference between the mean of groups.

There is 1 response numeric variable and 1 explanatory categorical variable with more than 1 level.

ANOVA considers the probability of observing the sample ratio of explained variance to unexplained variance (i.e. the F statistic)... if the null hypothesis is true that all population means are equal.

You can perform a one-way ANOVA very easily in R using the `aov` function etc. But what fun would that be?! 

On a serious note, it is really helpful to understand how the algorithm of the test works to calculate it 'by hand'.

First, let's load some libraries, and create some sample data.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(simplevis)

cat_var <- rep(c(8, 16, 32, 64), each = 8)

num_var <- c(1.4, 2.0, 3.2, 1.4, 2.3, 4.0, 5.0, 4.7,
           3.2, 6.8, 5.0, 2.5, 6.1, 4.8, 4.6, 4.2,
           6.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.0, 4.5, 6.4, 4.4, 4.1,
           5.8, 6.6, 6.5, 5.9, 5.9, 3.0, 5.9, 5.6)

data <- tibble(cat_var, num_var) %>% 
  mutate(cat_var = as.factor(cat_var))

head(data, n = 3)
```

Next, let's visualise the data.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
ggplot_boxplot(data, cat_var, num_var,
       y_zero = T,
       title = NULL,
       x_title = "Catagorical explanatory variable", 
       y_title = "Numeric response variable")
```

I'm going to use a fixed effects means model for simplicity (Model I).

Yij = Î¼i + Eij 

The hypotheses are as follow.

H0: _all_ population means are equal

H1: _not all_ population means are equal

We will use a significance level of p = 0.05.

Note the mean square error (MSE) is used to quantify variance, and this is obtained by dividing the sum of squared error (SSE) by the degrees of freedom (df).

1. Calculate SSE, df and MSE for if H1 is TRUE (i.e. complete model)

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
complete <- data %>%  
  group_by(cat_var) %>% 
  mutate(fit = mean(num_var)) %>% #in complete model, fit is the group mean 
  mutate(error = fit - num_var) %>% 
  mutate(sq_error = error ^ 2) %>%
  ungroup()

head(complete, 3)

(complete <- complete %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), sse = sum(sq_error)) %>% 
  mutate(p = length(unique(data$cat_var))) %>% 
  mutate(df = n - p) %>% 
  select(sse, df, n, p) %>% 
  mutate(mse = sse / df) # mse = sigma squared 
)
```

2. Calculate SSE, df and MSE for if H0 is TRUE (i.e. reduced model)

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
reduced <- data %>%  
  mutate(fit = mean(num_var)) %>% #in reduced model, fit is the overall mean 
  mutate(error = fit - num_var) %>% 
  mutate(sq_error = error ^ 2) %>%
  ungroup() 

head(reduced, 3)

(reduced <- reduced %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), sse = sum(sq_error)) %>% # sse = sum square error
  mutate(p = 1) %>% 
  mutate(df = n - p) %>% 
  select(sse, df, n, p)
)
```

3. Calculate the SSE, df and MSE explained by the complete model. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
(explained_sse <- reduced$sse - complete$sse)

(explained_df <- reduced$df - complete$df)

(explained_mse <- explained_sse / explained_df)
```

4. Calculate the ratio of variance (i.e. MSE) the complete model has explained to the variance (i.e. MSE) that is left unexplained. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
(f <- explained_mse / complete$mse)

pf(f, explained_df, complete$df, lower.tail = F)
```

There was a p < 0.05, so we will reject the null hyothesis, and accept that there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the groups.

Let's check whether we got it right... We did!

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
anova <- aov(num_var ~ cat_var, data)
summary(anova)
```

Of course, we should also check the assumptions:

* independence of observations
* constant variation across groups
* normal distribution of residual error.

We can do the last 2 visually, and the 1st by understanding the study design. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
data <- augment(anova)

ggplot_boxplot(data, cat_var, .resid,
  y_balance = TRUE,
  title = "Residual error across groups", 
  x_title = "Group", 
  y_title = "Residual error")
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data) +
  geom_qq(aes(sample = .resid)) +
  geom_qq_line(aes(sample = .resid)) +
  labs(title = "Normal Q-Q plot", 
       x = "Theoretical normal distribution quantile", 
       y = "Residual error quantile") +
  theme_point() 
```
